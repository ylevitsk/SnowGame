Use glm quaternions

glm, quaterions mix
glm/gcc/quaternion mix

Bone animations
Don't use rotate or scale

Pre and post- linear and quadratic interpolations

Parse through first node, get mesh out
Get past root to the first child
Assimp has a list of bones specified by name
Each node has a name
It's a tree
Specific node that has children
Or bones could be located off of root node, not off of mesh node
Parse through list of bones to see if there is a bone with the same name as the bone
Insert that into your hierarchy

Ai string can be directly compared using ==

Compute transformation at this current node

Base transformation
Should just be a part of the transformation

Continue down through hierarchy
Connect your bones to your mesh

Gives you a list of the vertices representing their weight compared to that bone
Movement of hip has no weight on movement of arm so weight is 0
Apply that amount of that transformation to that point

Each node has an animation field
It contains all the keyframe information for that node

Imagining hashtable
A field of your mesh
It has the matrix follow by a time stamp, key table by time stamp
Rather than constantly go through all this to get it

Parsed to the point where you got a mesh which means you got one step into the tree
Probable you're taken it directly out of the meshes array

Start traversing the tree
field called mRootNode
That is where the tree starts
assign as temp ainode root
start traversing tree using it as root
recursive function, pass it a node
each node has a manimations field
   array of animations
   scale, trans, rotate
mtransformation is base transformation for that node
   4x4 transformation that that node takes
mMeshes describes the index of the mesh in the array of meshes
   mNumMeshes tells you how many meshes are in that node
   could be 0 in case of bones
   0th index is index of mesh in array of meshes
import the mesh
all the other fields just give you name that you'll have to namecheck against bone's name

rummage through documentation
several pages not even linked to
materials are imported with a bunch of keys you have to pass
   predefined key
   aiMatKey, etc
not defined in main page
assimp material system will give you a better page for reading stuff
